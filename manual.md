## Game Description

* Game Objective: The goal of this game is to explore a dungeon with different passages each time and find the treasure chest hidden by the dragon!

* Player: You can move the player character, "@", using the arrow keys to go up, down, left, or right.

* Monsters: There are various monsters in the dungeon! For example, "a" is an Amoeba, not too strong but defeating it will level you up. "b" is a Bison, which gives you lots of food when defeated. There are many more monsters! However, monsters are initially shown as "?" but once you make contact, they'll be displayed as "a", "b", "c", etc., revealing their true identity.

* Fog System: In this game, only the areas you've walked through will be visible, thanks to the fog system. It works with auto-mapping, so once you visit an area, it remains fog-free.

* Combat: When you touch a monster, a battle ensues. If you fight a monster of the same or lower level, you can defeat it, gain a level, and acquire any items it has. But if you face a higher-level monster, you'll lose and respawn in a random location within the dungeon. Monsters generally don't move and wait for you to engage, so whether you fight or pass them by is up to you.

* Rare Types: Rare type monsters have amazing features compared to regular ones! For example, defeating the rare type "A" of "a" will level you up much faster. Defeating the rare type "B" of "b" will give you even more food than usual.

* Food System: Your food supply (hunger) decreases as you walk. If it reaches 0, you'll starve and it's game over, so be careful! Defeating "b" (Bison) will give you lots of food.

* Game End: The game ends when you obtain (touch) the dragon's treasure chest. Aim to be a treasure hunter!
